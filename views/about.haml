%p There are a bunch of services to check if a website is accessible from China.
%p Unfortunately most of them are not accurate.
%p I guarantee my results by doing actual HTTP requests from servers based in China.

%p A request might take a little while to return the result as I'm using proxies located in China, some of them are slow.

#thanks
